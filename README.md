# Introduction to study

## Background
Extra-territorial (prospecting) movement is assumed to be costly (Bonte et al. 2012), even acting as barriers to dispersal particularly among social vertebrates, but these costs remain poorly understood. Costs may include energetics, reduced food intake from vigilance against predaotrs or territorial conspecifics, 

Current literature focuses on physiological costs imposed on prospecting individuals. A study by Young & Monfort (2009) showed that prospecting male meerkats showed elevated fecal glucocorticoid metabolite levels during their forays. In both southern pied babblers and Seychelles warblers, floaters and prospectors, respectively, exhibited reduced body mass while outside the natal territory (Ridley et al. 2008; Kingma et al. 2016). 

However, body mass can be a tricky index of body condition because birds need to maintain an optimal body mass for efficient flight (CITE). 


## Hypotheses
1) Prospecting is physiologically demanding
    - Movement correlates positively with weight loss and oxidative stress measures
2) Prospecting is condition-dependent    
    - Initial body condition will correlate with prospecting effort throughout the breeding season
3) Sex-differences in costs exist
    - The dispersive sex (females) will suffer reduced costs compared to philopatric males

## Methods
I collected all data from a color-banded population of Florida scrub-jays at Archbold Biological Station in Venus, FL. 

### Body mass
Florida scrub-jays show small day-to-day mass fluctuations (less than 3% body mass of adult; Cucco & Bowman 2018). I collected weekly body mass of nonbreeders from February to March (the start of breeding season) of 2019. I trained Florida scrub-jays to perch on an electronic scale (Ohaus NV511 Precision Balance; repeatability 0.1 g with < 1 second stabilization time). I placed a video recorder on a tripod panning the scale LED then I scored the values back in the lab. Because Florida scrub-jays exhibit diurnal mass gain (Cucco & Bowman 2018), all weights were measured between 7 to 10 am, depending on when the group was located.

### Oxidative stress
I collected blood samples from all fledglings hatched in 2018 at three time points: hatchling (11 days old in nest), juvenile (fledged nest; 85-95 days old and nutritionally independent), and yearling (12 months old). Following ABS protocols, I  collected ~25μl of blood within one minute of capture and shipped samples to Cornell where they were stored in -80 °C until further analysis. Once returning to Ithaca, I performed oxidative stress assays in Dr. Maren Vitousek’s lab using d-ROMs and OXYAdsorbent kits (Diacron International, Italy), which measure reactive oxygen metabolites and antioxidant capacity, respectively (Costantini et al. 2008). 

### Prospecting movement

*Copied from Tringali et al. 2020*: 
"From February through April of 2016 and 2017, we surveyed for jays at points placed at least 200 m apart and non-randomly stratified across all territories (Fig. 1). Because sampling began just prior to the onset of breeding and before we map territories, we based the placement of sampling points on the territory boundaries mapped in April of the previous year. Territory boundaries are relatively stable but do fluctuate annually and within a season. 

We sampled these points twice a week in 2017 and 2018 using playback of territorial calls. Calls were sourced from recordings made in the same metapopulation as our study population (Coulon et al., 2008), but are several decades old. Thus, these calls are in the local dialect, but not from individuals known to any jays in our study. We randomized the order in which we visited points using a random number generator. We played territorial calls on a portable speaker for a total of 2 min, 30 s in each cardinal direction, with 30-second breaks after each. Then we waited an additional minute for birds to respond, so that each visit lasted a minimum of 5 min. We recorded the identities of all birds present at survey points using Survey123 (Esri, Redlands, CA, USA).

Use of playback is appropriate for this species for two reasons: (1) it mimics what occurs when there is a disturbance in the existing social structure, such as the death of a breeder, which are the types of opportunities foraying helpers are searching for and (2) breeders, dominants, and helpers all defend their territorial boundaries. In order for individuals to hear and respond to the playbacks, they must already be in the vicinity of the sampling point. Territories are large and scrub habitat is generally low and open, and we do not observe jays flying in from far away in response to the playbacks, which supports the idea that the individuals responding to playback are nearby. Florida scrub-jays are vigilant, territorial, and social, making them likely to detect jays along or within their territory boundary and interact with them. Therefore, we assume that individuals detected at a sampling point at the same time are associated. We have no reason to suspect that the associations we observe during sampling would not exist in the absence of the playbacks."
